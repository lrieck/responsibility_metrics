Welcome! 
I am from the north of Germany but have spent the last few years in a various countries, working on responsible sourcing and energy markets. As my daily work is not currently related to those topics, I decided to stay up-to-date and engaged in my free time. All content on this site is exclusively my work and does not represent any positions or opinions of any other parties.
